    application, however they must still agree to the iVEC conditions of

    Project Leaders will be research leaders within a scientific research
    group, laboratory, or community.

        <li>Being the primary point of contact between the project team members and iVEC</li>
        <li>Completing the project reports within 30 days at the end of the granting period</li>
        <li>Submitting requests to add/remove users to existing projects</li>

    </ul>
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Please note that iVEC will manage the allocation on a best effort basis but

    and that unused allocations will not roll over to the next allocation
    period.
