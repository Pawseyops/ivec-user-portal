Dear ${participant.name.strip()},

Your account at iVEC has been created. Your user name is ${uid} and your project is ${project}.

You should be able to;
  ssh -Y ${uid}@epic.ivec.org

When you have logged in, you can change your password by typing;

passwd

and follow the prompts.

You have a project directory on epic called /scratch/${project}/${uid}.
You have ${participant.application.hours_allocated} CPU hours allocated.

You can create whatever directory structure you like here and this is where you should run your jobs from. Please note that /home and /scratch are NOT backed up, so don't leave your data here.


Please read the online help which can be found at:

Additionaly, you can email help@ivec.org if you have any questions.
